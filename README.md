# pill-sorter

Machine learning model that sorts pills

Convolution neural network that classifies a pill based on a picture. This was built for a science fair project at Port Credit Secondary School. Which we won :).

Originally we were going build a device that could take that picture, classify the pill and sort it however we ran out of time for the device work. The model however functions exactly as intended. 

It uses:

- tensorflow
- keras
